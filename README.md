# **Target Detection In MSTAR Images**

>## ‚úç&nbsp; Problem Statement
## Target Detector :dart:!
Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) is an imaging radar that transmits microwaves which generates imagery through the reflected microwaves from the objects in both high and azimuth range resolutions. The good things about SAR is that it works in all weather conditions, day/night so it has many application areas like navigation, guidance, remote sensing, reconnaissance, resource exploration etc.. It is difficult to recognize an object in SAR imagery due to absence of colour information and shape reflection from a target changes. So, here the problem statement is to recognize the targets automatically in SAR have always been a challenge in research community.
